<h2>Problem Statement:</h2> 
Distance measures was used in vector models, namely, Cosine Angle Distance (CAD) queries in high dimensional data spaces. Using theoretical analysis and experimental results, this project showed the retrieval results baed on CAD when dimension is high.

<h2>Highlights:</h2>
1. One million data entries were used to generate result.
2. Result can be retrieved at whispering-sands-8504.herokuapp.com
